Description: Comparisons of floating point numbers are problematic due to errors
    associated with the binary representation of decimal numbers.
    Despite being aware of these problems, people still use numerical methods
    that fail to account for these and other rounding errors (this pitfall is
    the first to be highlighted in Circle 1 of Burns (2012)
    'The R Inferno' <https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf>).
    This package provides new relational operators useful for performing
    floating point number comparisons with a set tolerance.
Depends:
