Known issues: https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/fpCompare/issues

version 0.1.1
=============
* minor tweaks to docs formatting:

    - move `cph` to end of the author field so `aut` displays as first name
    - use short urls to avoid links spilling into margins


version 0.1.0
=============
* initial version
* adds new numeric relational operators that do comparisons using a tolerance value:

    - `%>=%`, `%<=%`, `%==%`, `%!=%`

* use `options(fpCompare.tolerance = value)` to set tolerance
